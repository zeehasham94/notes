please add the following directive in your wp-config 
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);

After adding the above parameter, Open the cron management tab of the respective application on the Cloudways Platform.
Here is the knowledge-based document:

We suggest setting the cron to run as the HTTP request which is the most feasible way. So try rewriting your cron as follows:

*/5 * * * * wget -q -O - https://your-domain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron

Please be informed that you have to replace the {your-domain.com} with your website domain.
