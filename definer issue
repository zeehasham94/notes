We would like to inform you that you are facing issue while importing the database because  
you have incorrect DEFINER  values  in your database  
if anytime you see this error while importing the database you will replace the  
DEFINER trigger with Cloudways database username  i.e.
For example in a case, 
you will replace DEFINER=`use_dev`@`localhost`   to  DEFINER=`tzqgvtayec`@`%` in your SQL file then re-upload the database everything will work fine then.
